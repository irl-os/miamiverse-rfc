RFC Process for Real Estate Summit & Miamiverse Launch

Objective: Create actionable proposals demonstrating how spatial computing enhances real estate workflows today while building toward long-term digital twin capabilities.
1. Simplified RFC Structure (Non-Technical Focus)

Repo: github.com/miamiverse/rfc
Template:
markdown
Copy

# [Proposal Title] (e.g., "Virtual Zoning Overlays")

## Problem Statement  
*What real-world real estate challenge does this address?*  
(e.g., "Developers struggle to visualize zoning restrictions in context")

## Spatial Solution  
*How does Miamiverse/Spatio Protocol solve this?*  
(e.g., "AR overlay showing FAR limits and setback rules when viewing a property via mobile")

## Data Sources  
*Which Miami-Dade web2 systems/data can be used?*  
(e.g., Miami-Dade Zoning GIS API + Property Appraiser records)

## Stakeholder Impact  
- Residents: [Benefit]  
- RE Professionals: [Benefit]  
- Government: [Benefit]  

## Next Steps  
- [ ] Data access approval from [Department]  
- [ ] Prototype design by [Date]  

Process:

    Pre-Summit Brainstorm: Seed repo with 3-5 "Starter RFCs" aligned with summit themes.

        Example: "RFC #1: XR Site Walks ‚Äì Embedding Construction Plans in Physical Spaces"

    Summit Participation:

        Live RFC board at venue (digital + physical)

        QR codes linking to RFC submissions on property listings

    Voting: Attendees "react" to RFCs via GitHub emojis:

        üè† = Resident priority

        üìà = Developer priority

        üöÄ = Quick win

2. Immediate Demo Opportunities (Low-Code)

A. "Living Listings" Prototype

    Tech Stack:

        Miami-Dade Property Appraiser API (existing web2)

        Spatio Protocol (basic location tagging)

        A-Frame/AR.js (web-based AR)

    Demo Flow:

        Scan QR code on physical "For Sale" sign

        AR overlay shows:

            Zoning boundaries

            3D approved building envelope

            Nearby Spatio Protocol-enabled amenities (e.g., WAVŒû RIDŒûRS cleanup zones)

B. "Community Memory" Timeline

    Data: Historic preservation records + permit data

    Spatio Feature: temporal_window in SpatialAddress

    Demo: Swipe through time layers on a lot:

        1980s: Single-family home

        2024: Proposed mixed-use building

        2040: Sea-level rise projection

C. Summit-Specific Features

    Spatial Agenda: Sessions mapped to physical locations in Miamiverse.

    Live Polling: Attendees stake location-based opinions:

        "Where should Miamiverse expand next?" (votes tied to map coordinates)

3. Stakeholder Engagement Tracks

For Residents:

    RFC Idea: "See Future Developments in My Neighborhood"

    Tool: Web-based viewer embedding Miamiverse data into Miami-Dade‚Äôs existing property search portal.

For Developers:

    RFC Idea: "Automated Impact Reports via Spatial Data"

    Tool: Spatio Protocol + ChatGPT to generate traffic/environmental analyses from county data.

For Government:

    RFC Idea: "Permit Application AR Preview"

    Demo: Tablet showing proposed building heights against existing skyline.

4. Post-Summit Roadmap

Week 1: Publish "RFC Leaderboard" showing top proposals by stakeholder group.
Month 1: Pilot winning RFC with 3 properties (e.g., Coconut Grove historic district).
Q3 2024: Launch "Adopt-a-Block" program ‚Äì neighborhoods propose Miamiverse features.
Key Messaging for Summit

    For Skeptics: "This isn‚Äôt about replacing Miami ‚Äì it‚Äôs about giving every street corner a voice."

    For Innovators: "The RFC process turns NIMBY into YIMBY ‚Äì Yes In My Backyard 2.0."

    For Government: "Miamiverse is a collaborative layer, not a replacement for existing systems."

By focusing on concrete real estate use cases and an accessible RFC process, you‚Äôll turn summit attendees into co-creators while laying groundwork for deeper technical integration. üèóÔ∏è
